## ExoBrainTon:    
* An exoskeleton controlled by brain waves to provide the disabled with the ability to walk.    
[Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3ytl6m0l7I)    
* brain waves is recorded by Emotiv headset electrodes , then send data to MainComputer to pre-process the signals and classify it using machine learning algorithm that implemented with python . in the end we get Walk and Stop command that will be sent to MiniComputer placed in exoskeleton , it do control processes like walk pattern generation , kinematic functions and drive motors.    
* in this repository,there is all files that related with walk algorithm and control exoskeleton,it debend on Thormang packages.
